The tool consists of four parts: An input map, an observing plan, an instrument, and a site. All are then combined in a wrapper named Simulation. As explained in the section \"Usage\", we can emulate all kinds of telescopes, like ACT, Toltec, GBT, and AtLAST. \n",

This built-in mapper follows a straightforward approach: it removes the common mode over all detectors (the atmosphere if you scan fast enough), then detrends and optionally Fourier filters the time-streams to remove any noise smaller than the resolution of the dish. Then, the mapper bins the TOD on the specified grid. Notably, the mapper is designed to effectively eliminate correlated atmospheric noise among different scans, thereby increasing SNR of the output map.\n",
