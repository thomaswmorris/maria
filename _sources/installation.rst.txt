Installation
============

You can install ``maria`` from the command line with ``pip`` as::

    pip install maria

or from the source as::

    git clone https://github.com/thomaswmorris/maria
    cd maria
    pip install -e .

For some mapmaking and cosmology applications, ``pymaster`` (the Python implementation of NaMaster) is required.
Running::

    conda install -c conda-forge namaster

should work; check their `installation guide <https://namaster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_ for support.
